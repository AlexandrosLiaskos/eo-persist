# Vulnerability Indices

This section describes the various vulnerability indices used to assess Arctic permafrost regions.

## Overview

Vulnerability indices are composite metrics that help assess the susceptibility of different areas to permafrost degradation and its impacts.

## Types of Indices

### Physical Vulnerability
- Thermal state index
- Ground ice content
- Active layer thickness
- Soil properties

### Infrastructure Vulnerability
- Building stability risk
- Road network vulnerability
- Pipeline risk assessment
- Coastal erosion risk

### Ecological Vulnerability
- Vegetation sensitivity
- Biodiversity risk
- Ecosystem stability
- Carbon release potential

### Socioeconomic Vulnerability
- Population exposure
- Economic assets at risk
- Traditional land use impact
- Resource accessibility

## Methodology

### Data Integration
- Remote sensing inputs
- Ground measurements
- Socioeconomic data
- Climate projections

### Calculation Methods
- Weighted overlay analysis
