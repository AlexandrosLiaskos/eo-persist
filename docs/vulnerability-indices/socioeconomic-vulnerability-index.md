## Overview

The Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SeVI) helps identify communities that may need support before, during, and after coastal hazards based on their socioeconomic characteristics. This guide focuses on coastal communities and their unique vulnerabilities.

### Key Components

| Theme | Variables | Data Sources | Weight |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Socioeconomic Status | â€¢ Poverty<br>â€¢ Employment<br>â€¢ Income<br>â€¢ Education | Census data | High |
| Household Composition | â€¢ Age 65 or older<br>â€¢ Age 17 or younger<br>â€¢ Disability<br>â€¢ Single-parent households | Census data | High |
| Housing & Transportation | â€¢ Multi-unit structures<br>â€¢ Mobile homes<br>â€¢ Crowding<br>â€¢ No vehicle | Census/ACS | Medium |
| Coastal Economic Dependencies | â€¢ Fishing industry<br>â€¢ Tourism<br>â€¢ Port activities<br>â€¢ Coastal businesses | Economic data | Medium |

## Implementation

### 1. Data Collection

#### Required Datasets
* Census demographic data
* American Community Survey (ACS)
* Economic indicators
* Infrastructure data
* Coastal industry data

#### Data Sources
* [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
* [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)
* [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)
* [NOAA Digital Coast](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/)

### 2. Data Processing

#### Census Data Preparation
1. Download census tract data
2. Clean and standardize variables
3. Handle missing values
4. Calculate percentages

#### Economic Data Integration
1. Process employment data
2. Calculate industry dependencies
3. Assess economic diversity
4. Map economic centers

### 3. Index Calculation

#### Variable Percentile Ranks
Each variable is ranked from 0 to 1 based on percentile rank:

| Percentile | Vulnerability Level | Example (Poverty) |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0-0.20 | Very Low | <5% below poverty |
| 0.20-0.40 | Low | 5-10% below poverty |
| 0.40-0.60 | Moderate | 10-15% below poverty |
| 0.60-0.80 | High | 15-20% below poverty |
| 0.80-1.00 | Very High | >20% below poverty |

#### SeVI Formula
```
Theme Score = Î£(Variable Percentile Ranks) / n
Overall SeVI = Î£(Theme Scores) / 4

Where:
n = number of variables in theme
Theme scores are calculated for each of the 4 themes
```

### 4. Validation & Quality Control

#### Validation Methods
* Statistical testing
* Temporal comparison
* Spatial autocorrelation
* Expert review

#### Quality Metrics
* Data completeness
* Statistical significance
* Temporal consistency
* Geographic coverage

## Best Practices

### Data Management
* Document data sources
* Track variable changes
* Maintain metadata
* Version control

### Analysis Tips
* Consider local context
* Account for seasonality
* Validate with local knowledge
* Document assumptions

### Visualization
* Use appropriate scales
* Show confidence intervals
* Include contextual layers
* Clear documentation

## Coastal Applications

### Risk Assessment
* Storm surge impacts
* Evacuation planning
* Recovery capacity
* Resource allocation

### Integration with CVI
* Combined vulnerability assessment
* Multi-hazard planning
* Adaptation strategies
* Policy development

## Special Considerations for Coastal Areas

### Seasonal Population
* Tourist impacts
* Seasonal workers
* Second homes
* Service demands

### Economic Dependencies
* Fishing communities
* Tourism industry
* Port activities
* Coastal businesses

### Infrastructure
* Transportation access
* Emergency services
* Critical facilities
* Evacuation routes
