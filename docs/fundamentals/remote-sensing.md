# 🛰️ Remote Sensing Fundamentals

## What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance, typically using aircraft or satellites. It involves:

- 📡 **Data Acquisition**: Capturing electromagnetic radiation reflected or emitted from Earth
- 🔍 **Data Analysis**: Processing and interpreting the collected data
- 🗺️ **Information Extraction**: Converting data into meaningful insights

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum is fundamental to remote sensing:

| Region | Wavelength | Applications |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Visible | 0.4-0.7 μm | Land use mapping, water quality |
| Near-IR | 0.7-1.3 μm | Vegetation health, biomass |
| Short-wave IR | 1.3-3.0 μm | Mineral mapping, soil moisture |
| Thermal IR | 3.0-14 μm | Surface temperature, heat mapping |
| Microwave | 1 mm - 1 m | All-weather imaging, soil moisture |

## Sensor Types and Characteristics

### 1. Passive Sensors
- **Optical Sensors**: Capture reflected sunlight
    - Multispectral (4-12 bands)
    - Hyperspectral (100s of bands)
- **Thermal Sensors**: Detect emitted heat
    - Day/night capability
    - Temperature mapping

### 2. Active Sensors
- **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**
    - All-weather capability
    - Surface deformation
    - Soil moisture
- **LiDAR**
    - 3D mapping
    - Forest structure
    - Urban modeling

## Resolution Types

Remote sensing data is characterized by four types of resolution:

| Resolution Type | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Spatial | Ground area covered by one pixel | 10m (Sentinel-2) |
| Temporal | Time between repeat observations | 5 days (Sentinel-2) |
| Spectral | Number and width of spectral bands | 13 bands (Sentinel-2) |
| Radiometric | Sensitivity to energy differences | 12-bit |
