# Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SVI)

## Overview

The Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SVI) measures the resilience of Arctic communities to environmental changes by analyzing social, economic, and demographic factors. This index helps identify communities that may need additional support in adapting to climate-related challenges.

## Components

### Social Factors
- Population demographics
- Education levels
- Healthcare access
- Social networks
- Cultural resources

### Economic Indicators
- Income levels
- Employment rates
- Economic diversity
- Infrastructure access
- Resource dependency

### Community Capacity
- Institutional strength
- Traditional knowledge
- Technical capacity
- Emergency services
- Communication networks

## Calculation Methodology

### Data Integration Steps

1. Calculate Social Vulnerability
   - Process demographic indicators
   - Evaluate education metrics
   - Assess healthcare access
   - Analyze cultural resources

2. Calculate Economic Vulnerability
   - Process income data
   - Evaluate employment rates
   - Assess economic diversity
   - Analyze infrastructure access

3. Calculate Community Capacity

   - Assess traditional knowledge
   - Analyze emergency services

4. Final SVI Calculation
   - Combine component scores
   - Apply weighting factors
   - Normalize results
   - Quality assessment
