# ❄️ Permafrost Science

## What is Permafrost?

Permafrost is ground (soil or rock and included ice and organic material) that remains at or below 0°C for at least two consecutive years. It plays a crucial role in:

- 🌡️ Global climate regulation
- 🌍 Arctic ecosystem stability
- 🏗️ Infrastructure development
- 🌿 Carbon storage and release

## Distribution and Classification

### Permafrost Zones

| Zone | Coverage | Temperature | Depth |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Continuous | >90% | < -5°C | Up to 1500m |
| Discontinuous | 50-90% | -5 to -2°C | 100-500m |
| Sporadic | 10-50% | -2 to 0°C | 10-100m |
| Isolated | <10% | ~0°C | <10m |

### Key Components

1. **Active Layer**
    - Seasonally thawed surface layer
    - Typical depth: 0.5-2m
    - Critical for ecosystems
    - Annual freeze-thaw cycles

2. **Transition Zone**
    - Between active layer and permafrost
    - Experiences occasional thaw
    - Important for thermal stability

3. **Permafrost Table**
    - Upper boundary of permafrost
    - Key reference for monitoring
    - Indicator of change

## Ground Ice Types

### Classification by Formation

| Type | Formation | Characteristics | Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Segregated Ice | In-situ freezing | Lenses and layers | High thaw settlement |
| Wedge Ice | Thermal contraction | Polygonal networks | Surface deformation |
| Massive Ice | Buried glacier/water | Large bodies | Major terrain collapse |
| Pore Ice | Soil moisture | Fills soil pores | Moderate settlement |
