# EO-PERSIST: Cloud-Based Remote Sensing Data System for Arctic Research

## Project Overview

EO-PERSIST is a 48-month project (January 1, 2023 â€“ December 31, 2026) funded by the European Union's Horizon TMA MSCA Staff Exchanges program. Our objective is to understand the impacts of climate change on Arctic environments, infrastructures, and industries by developing a cloud-based system for collecting, managing, and analyzing Earth Observation (EO) data suitable for permafrost studies.
