# Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI)

## Overview

The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) quantifies the vulnerability of coastal regions to environmental changes. This index combines geomorphological, physical, and oceanographic factors to assess coastal sensitivity to sea-level rise, erosion, and other coastal hazards.

## Components

### Geomorphological Indicators

#### Coastal Slope
- Nearshore slope measurements
- Backshore elevation
- Coastal relief
- Terrain analysis

#### Coastal Geomorphology
- Shoreline type
- Sediment characteristics
- Coastal landforms
- Barrier systems

#### Historical Shoreline Change
- Erosion/accretion rates
- Shoreline position
- Temporal trends
- Seasonal variations

### Physical Process Indicators

#### Wave Height
- Mean wave height
- Storm wave characteristics
- Wave energy distribution
- Directional analysis

#### Tidal Range
- Mean tidal range
- Tidal variations
- Extreme water levels
- Tidal currents

#### Sea-Level Change
- Regional trends
- Local subsidence
- Isostatic adjustment
- Historical records

### Environmental Factors

#### Sea Ice Conditions
- Ice coverage duration
- Ice thickness
- Ice-free season length
- Ice dynamics

#### Permafrost State
- Ground temperature
- Active layer depth
- Ground ice content
- Thermal regime

#### Storm Frequency
- Storm occurrence
- Wind patterns
- Storm surge levels
- Seasonal distribution

## Calculation Methodology
